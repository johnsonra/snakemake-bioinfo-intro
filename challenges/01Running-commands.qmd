## The sample dataset

The sample dataset represents a transcriptomics experiment in brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under three conditions:

* `etoh60` - Treated with 60% ethanol
* `temp33` - Treated at 33 degrees celsius
* `ref` - Untreated

For each condition there are 3 repeats, making 9 total samples.

## Challenge 1

Run `snakemake --help | less` to see the help for all available options (or google the help file). What does the `-p` option in the snakemake command above do?

* Protects existing output files
* Prints the shell commands that are being run to the terminal <!-- correct -->
* Tells Snakemake to only run one process at a time
* Prompts the user for the correct input file

## Challenge 2

Modify the Snakefile to count the number of sequences in `reads/ref1_1.fq`, rather than the number of lines.

* Rename the rule to "countreads"
* Keep the output file name the same
* Remember that the result needs to go into the output file, not just be printed on the screen.

## Challenge 3

Add a second rule to count the sequences in `reads/etoh60_1_1.fq`. Add this to the same Snakefile you already made, under the "countreads" rule, and run your rules in the terminal. When running the snakemake command youâ€™ll need to tell Snakemake to make both the output files.
