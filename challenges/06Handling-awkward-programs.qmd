## FastQC

![](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics/fig/fastqc.png)

## Challenge 1

Fill in the `???` to make a working rule for FastQC where `indir` may be "reads" or "trimmed". Do not change the shell command or input pattern at all. Remember FastQC always makes two output files, so add two named outputs.

```
rule fastqc:
    output:
        ???
    input:  "{indir}/{myfile}.fq"
    shell:
        "fastqc {input}"
```

## Challenge 2

Modify the rule so that the output files go into a new directory. This will be very similar to the rule for kallisto quant added in episode 3.

For example, when running on the file "trimmed/ref_1_1.fq" the outputs should be

```
trimmed.fastqc.ref_1_1/ref_1_1_fastqc.html
trimmed.fastqc.ref_1_1/ref_1_1_fastqc.zip
```

## Challenge 3

Complete the rule below so that the output filenames are correctly produced. You will need to add extra commands to the `shell` part after running `fastqc`. Do not alter the `output` or `input` parts of the rule.

```
rule fastqc:
    output:
        html = "{indir}.{myfile}_fastqc.html",
        zip  = "{indir}.{myfile}_fastqc.zip"
    input:  "{indir}/{myfile}.fq"
    shell:
        """???
        """
```
