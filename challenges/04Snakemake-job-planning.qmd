## DAG of jobs

## Challenge 1

If we asked Snakemake to run `kallisto_quant` on all three of the reference samples (ref1, ref2, ref3), how many jobs would that be in total?

## Challenge 2

Run `kallisto_quant` on all three of the etoh60 samples. Now edit the Snakefile so that the `qual_threshold` for `trimreads` is "22", rather than "20".

How would you get Snakemake to update all three Kallisto results:

1. By using the -R flag
2. By using the -f flag
3. By using the touch command
4. By deleting some of the existing files
