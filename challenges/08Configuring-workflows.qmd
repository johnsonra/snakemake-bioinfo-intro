## Challenge 1

Modify the existing salmon_index rule so that the -k setting (k-mer length) is a parameter.

Change the length to 29 and re-build the index with the amended rule.

## Challenge 2

Fix the *salmon_index* rule to use `salmon_kmer_len` as in the config file sample above. Use a default of "29" if no config setting is supplied.

Run Snakemake in *dry run* mode (`-n`) to check that this is working as expected.

## Challenge 3

Modify the *Snakefile* and *config.yaml* so that you are setting the `CONDITIONS` and `REPLICATES` in the config file. Lists in YAML use the same syntax as Python, with square brackets and commas, so you can copy the lists you already have. Note that youâ€™re not expected to modify any rules here.

Re-run the workflow to make a report on *just replicates 2 and 3*. Check the MultiQC report to see that it really does have just these replicates in there.
